# Functions And Nested Loops
### A nested loop is when you have a loop inside another loop's body.

Note: You need to create your main.h file first, which should include the prototypes of all your functions and the _putchar function. (See the resources below for your reference)
##The `main.h` file is the header file that contains all the function prototypes used in this project... >>>> THIS FILE IS VERY IMPORTANT
- [**0-Putchar**](0-putchar.c):  is a program that prints -putchar, followed by a new line.
- [**1-Alphabet**](1-alphabet.c):  is a function that prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by a new line.
- [**2-Print_alphabet_x10**](2-print_alphabet_x10.c):  is a function that prints the lowercase alphabet 10 times, followed by a new line.
- [**3-Islower**](3-islower.c): is a function that checks if a character is lowercase.
- [**3-Islower**](3-islower.c): 4-isalpha.c is a function that checks if a character is alphabetic.
- [**3-Islower**](3-islower.c): 5-sign.c is a function that prints the sign of a number.
- [**3-Islower**](3-islower.c):e 6-abs.c is a function that calculates the absolute value of an integer.
- [**3-Islower**](3-islower.c): 7-print_last_digit.c is a function that prints the last digit of a number.
- [**3-Islower**](8-24_hours.c):  is a function that prints every minute of Jack Bauer's day, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
- [**3-10-add**](10-add.c):  is a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- [**11-Print_to_98**](11-print_to_98.c):  is a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
```File: `_putchar.c` contains the definition of the _putchar() function.```
# Advanced Task
- [**100-Times_table**](100-times_table.c):  is a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
- [**101-Natural**](101-natural.c):  is a program that calculates and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
- [**102-Fibonacci**](102-fibonacci.c):  is a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
- [**103-Fibonacci**](103-fibonacci.c):  is a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms of the Fibonacci sequence under 4000000, followed by a new line.
- [**104-Fibonacci**](104-fibonacci.c):  is a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
