# Functions And Nested Loops
### A nested loop is when you have a loop inside another loop's body.

Note: You need to create your main.h file first, which should include the prototypes of all your functions and the _putchar function. (See the resources below for your reference)
** The main.h file is the header file that contains all the function prototypes used in this project... >>>> THIS FILE IS VERY IMPORTANT
==> File: 0-putchar.c is a program that prints -putchar, followed by a new line.
==> File: 1-alphabet.c is a function that prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by a new line.
==> File: 2-print_alphabet_x10.c is a function that prints the lowercase alphabet 10 times, followed by a new line.
==> File: 3-islower.c is a function that checks if a character is lowercase.
==> File: 4-isalpha.c is a function that checks if a character is alphabetic.
==> File 5-sign.c is a function that prints the sign of a number.
==> File 6-abs.c is a function that calculates the absolute value of an integer.
==> File 7-print_last_digit.c is a function that prints the last digit of a number.
==> File 8-24_hours.c is a function that prints every minute of Jack Bauer's day, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
==> File 10-add.c is a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
==> File 11-print_to_98.c is a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
File: `_putchar.c` contains the definition of the _putchar() function.
Advanced Task
===> File 100-times_table.c is a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
===> File 101-natural.c is a program that calculates and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
===> File 102-fibonacci.c is a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
===> File 103-fibonacci.c is a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms of the Fibonacci sequence under 4000000, followed by a new line.
===> File 104-fibonacci.c is a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
