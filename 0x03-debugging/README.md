Welcome to my **Debugging Practice Project**! 🚀 In this project, I've embarked on a journey of identifying and fixing errors in software. I'm elated to announce that I've triumphed over all the challenges! Let's dive into my accomplishments:

## 🌟 Learning and Triumphs

Through this immersive project, I've achieved the following:

- 🧠 Gained a deep understanding of the debugging process and its pivotal role in software development.
- 🔍 Explored hands-on manual debugging techniques, a crucial skillset for programmers and engineers.
- 📜 Mastered the art of deciphering error messages, a superpower for detecting coding gremlins.

## 👁‍🗨 Project Showcase

This repository showcases my prowess in debugging through a series of captivating tasks. Let's unravel my journey:

### 0. Multiple Mains

In this task, I flexed my skills by testing the `positive_or_negative()` function. I scripted a test file named `0-main.c`, meticulously verifying the function's behavior, especially with the notorious value of 0.

### 1. Like, Comment, Subscribe

I encountered an enchanting dance with an infinite loop! Employing my magic wand of coding, I elegantly commented out specific code lines, gracefully evading the loop's bewitchment and saving the day.

### 2. 0 > 972?

An enigma was unraveled as I turned my focus to a perplexing program. My careful examination and incantations corrected the riddle in `2-largest_number.c`, ensuring the true champion amongst three integers surfaced.

### 3. Leap Year

In this enthralling task, I embarked on a journey through time—a program that navigates dates to unveil days remaining in the year, even accounting for the elusive leap years. With my coding compass calibrated, I rectified the code in `3-print_remaining_days.c`, revealing the truth for diverse dates and leap years.
